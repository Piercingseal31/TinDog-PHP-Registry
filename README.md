## üìñ About The Project

Lack of socialization is a known cause of behavioral issues in dogs, such as anxiety and aggression. This is a common problem for owners in urban areas and for dogs acquired during the pandemic. TinDog provides a fun, polished, and easy way for owners to find suitable playmates for their pets in a controlled environment.

This project is a feature-rich, front-end application built with modern UI/UX principles. It includes a complete user authentication flow, a dynamic and interactive dashboard, and a fully functional swipe-based matching system.

### ‚ú® Key Features

* **Interactive Swiping:** A fully implemented, touch-and-drag compatible swiping interface on the "Find Matches" page, complete with dynamic "Like" & "Nope" stamps for visual feedback.
* **Dynamic Dashboard:** A completely overhauled dashboard featuring animated KPI cards, a live activity feed, and a dynamic "Tip of the Day" powered by JavaScript.
* **Polished User Profiles:** A redesigned, modern profile page with interactive hover effects and a clean, scannable layout for key details.
* **Enhanced App Pages:** Significant UI/UX improvements to the Notifications, Settings, My Matches, and Messages pages, including interactive filters, dynamic content, and a fully responsive mobile design.
* **Component-Based Architecture:** The front-end is built with a modular approach, using a JavaScript component loader to dynamically build pages, keeping the code clean and maintainable.
